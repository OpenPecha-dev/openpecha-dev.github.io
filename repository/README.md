### How to find texts on GitHub
Each Tibetan text is stored in its own repository. This repository is named after the text’s BDRC Resource ID, a reference number given by the Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC).
If you don’t know the BDRC Resource ID for the text you’re looking for, search for it directly on the BDRC website. Then search for that BDRC Resource ID on GitHub. Or search for the text’s title in Tibetan on GitHub.
