The OpenPecha project is providing:
- a [format](format/) to represent a text with all sorts of annotations
- a [toolkit](toolkit/) working on the format (import / export, update, etc.)
- a [repository](repository/) of texts in this format
- a [catalog](catalog/) of all the text published in this format

OpenPecha is an open collaborative initiative started by [BDRC](tbrc.org). 

Note that despite the Tibetan origin of the name (དཔེ་ཆ།), the format is not specific to this language.
