OpenPecha is a collaborative repository of e-texts and annotations focused on Buddhist knowledge. 

The OpenPecha dataset is made available in two ways: through the OpenPecha APIs and on Github. Our dataset is gradually increasing in quantity and quality through direct contributions from core members and from apps using our APIs.

OpenPecha is structured as three APIs: Librarian, Scholar, and Professional. 

**The Librarian API** functions as a librarian would. Ask where you can get a book or a list of books on a given topic, and you'll get actual book files or information about books. 
**The Scholar API** functions as a scholar would. If you want information about a subject, you'll get a detailed answer in the form of citations from the reference literature. 
**The Professional API** functions as an experienced working professional would. Ask it questions and it will give simple, to-the-point answers that are relevant to your situation.
